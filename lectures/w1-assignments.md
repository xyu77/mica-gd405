## Watch video tutorials

We will use Dan Shiffman's Coding Train as course supplement. Watch the video tutorials below and try running some example codes in Processing. You may fast-forward, speed up or rewatch as necessary. _Take notes and post screenshots of your digital or written notes (as a proof of your time spent with the materials) on Google drive._ If some of the contents do not make sense, bring back questions next class. **If the assignment is not ready in Google Drive by the beginning of next class, it will be marked late.**

## Karel exercises (optional)
This is an optional assignment. If you want to keep practicing with Stanford Karel, you can continue on your own. It will definitely be helpful although not required. Keep in mind the website is broken from Unit 10 on, and Unit 8 Lesson 5 is quite difficult.

If you have an iPad, you can download an app called Swift Playground. It's very similar to Karel, and teaches you fundamentals of coding and algorithms.
