# Week 11 assignments

Based on the feedbacks you got from your peers, choose one idea (or combine into one) for the final project. Prepare an idea/research presentation. Your presentation should be *professional* with its contents and its design. Create a multi-page PDF file that has all the text, images, links included.

What you may include:

- your own design concept and goal
- research on the topic
- any sketches and/or mockups
- inspirations
- references: anything similar has been done by other people? how is yours different from them?
- resources (example codes, techniques, etc.)
