# Week 11 assignments

Based on the feedbacks you got from your peers, choose one idea (or combine into one) for the final project. **Prepare a formal idea/research presentation**. Your presentation should be *professional* with its contents and its design. Create a multi-page PDF file that has all the text, images, links included.

What you may include:

- your own design concept and goal
- research on the topic
- any sketches and/or mockups
- inspirations
- references
- resources (example codes, techniques, etc.)

Some questions to ask yourself and include in your presentation:

- what are you exploring with the project?
- what is the goal (for yourself or for other people/users)?
- how is it related to graphic design and typography?
- anything similar has been done by other people? what can you learn from them?
- how is yours different from them?
- what is your weekly plan?
